Creating new project using Cargo

~~~
cargo new hello_cargo --bin       --> create binary application project
cargo build                       --> build the project
cargo build --release             --> build for release
cargo run                         --> run the executable
~~~

Note: Rust macros have `!` at the end of statement like this `println!`.
